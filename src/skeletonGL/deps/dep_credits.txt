| | | | | | ============                                                         | | | | | |
| | | | | |                                                                      | | | | | |
| | | | | |   The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages; | | | | | |
| | | | | |   some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, | | | | | |
| | | | | |   various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the | | | | | |
| | | | | |   FreeType Project.                                                  | | | | | |
| | | | | |                                                                      | | | | | |
| | | | | |   This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and | | | | | |
| | | | | |   which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license | | | | | |
| | | | | |   affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs, | | | | | |
| | | | | |   documentation and makefiles, at the very least.                    | | | | | |
| | | | | |                                                                      | | | | | |
| | | | | |   This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG | | | | | |
| | | | | |   (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion | | | | | |
| | | | | |   and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products | | | | | |
| | | | | |   alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:                | | | | | |
| | | | | |                                                                      | | | | | |
| | | | | |     o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be | | | | | |
| | | | | |       interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)  | | | | | |
| | | | | |                                                                      | | | | | |
| | | | | |     o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or | | | | | |
| | | | | |       full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)    | | | | | |
| | | | | |                                                                      | | | | | |
| | | | | |     o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use | | | | | |
| | | | | |       it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge | | | | | |
| | | | | |       somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the | | | | | |
| | | | | |       FreeType code. (`credits')                                     | | | | | |
| | | | | |                                                                      | | | | | |
| | | | | |   We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this | | | | | |
| | | | | |   software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products. | | | | | |
| | | | | |   We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and | | | | | |
| | | | | |   assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.               | | | | | |

| | | | | |   Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a | | | | | |
| | | | | |   credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus | | | | | |
